Decision Support System for Great Western Railways

This repository provides the code and resources for the project "Building a Decision Support System for Great Western Railways (GWR)," authored by Pranav Desai. The project aims to optimize train flow and improve operational efficiency by leveraging the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm within a user-friendly decision support system (DSS).

Overview:
The reliability and efficiency of public transport systems, particularly railways, are increasingly challenged by rising demand and customer expectations. Great Western Railways (GWR), a historic railway company, faces the need to efficiently manage its vast network spanning 3,800 miles across southwestern and southern England. This project addresses these challenges by developing a sophisticated decision support system that aids in managing unexpected demand spikes, such as those during events or weekends.

Building the Decision Support System (DSS):

Development of the DSS using VBA for Excel to implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
Incorporation of a user-friendly interface to facilitate input and output processes for route managers.
Integration of Depth First Search (DFS) for network connectivity checks.
Maximum Flow Results


Results:
The DSS developed in this project allows GWR to:

Determine the maximum number of trains that can be dispatched between specified source and destination stations.
Manage unexpected demand spikes efficiently.
Improve customer satisfaction by optimizing train flow and reducing delays.

Usage:
To use the decision support system:

Clone the repository.
Open the provided Excel file.
Use the "Run Ford-Fulkerson" button to input source and destination stations and determine the maximum train flow.
Use the "Enter New Network" button to add new stations and rail segments to the network.
Refer to the user manual included in the Excel file for detailed instructions.

Conclusion:
This project provides a robust decision support system for Great Western Railways, leveraging the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to optimize train flow and improve operational efficiency. Future enhancements could include real-time data integration and expanded functionalities to address dynamic railway network challenges.
